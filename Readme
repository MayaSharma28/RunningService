Suggestion: Please consider replacing System.out.println statements with a logging framework (e.g., SLF4J + Logback).

üîç System.out.println is not recommended in production or collaborative environments because:
	‚Ä¢	It lacks log level control (info, debug, warn, error).
	‚Ä¢	Logs can‚Äôt be filtered or redirected easily.
	‚Ä¢	It clutters the console and makes debugging harder in large systems.

‚úÖ Logging frameworks:
	‚Ä¢	Improve maintainability and observability.
	‚Ä¢	Support structured logs and integration with tools like ELK/Splunk.
	‚Ä¢	Allow environment-based logging level control.
