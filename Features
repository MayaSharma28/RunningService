Feature: Retrieve account information for an affiliate

  Scenario: Successfully return account information when valid headers are provided
    Given the affiliate service endpoint "/affiliate/accounts" is available
    And the request contains the header "X-Affiliate-Id" with value "AFF1234"
    And the request contains a valid "Authorization" token
    When a GET request is made to the service
    And the service validates the headers successfully
    And the service triggers an event to fetch account details
    Then the response should return HTTP status 200 OK
    And the response should contain all the account information for affiliate "AFF1234"


Scenario: Reject the request when invalid headers are provided
  Given the affiliate service endpoint "/affiliate/accounts" is available
  And the request contains the header "X-Affiliate-Id" with value "INVALID_ID"
  And the request contains an invalid "Authorization" token
  When a GET request is made to the service
  And the service fails to validate the headers
  Then the response should return HTTP status 401 Unauthorized
  And the response body should contain an error message "Invalid credentials or affiliate ID"

Scenario Outline: Validate header combinations for account retrieval
  Given the service "/affiliate/accounts" is available
  And the request contains header "X-Affiliate-Id" with value "<affiliateId>"
  And the request contains header "Authorization" with token "<authToken>"
  When a GET request is made
  Then the service should respond with status <statusCode>

  Examples:
    | affiliateId | authToken         | statusCode |
    | AFF1234     | valid-token       | 200        |
    | INVALID     | valid-token       | 401        |
    | AFF1234     | invalid-token     | 401        |
    |             |                   | 401        |
