✅ Goal of a 401 Test

A 401 Unauthorized response occurs when:
	•	The user did not provide any token, or
	•	The user provided an invalid or tampered token, or
	•	The token is expired or revoked

Your job is to simulate these situations and ensure the API correctly responds with a 401.

🧭 Strategy to Execute a 401 Test in BDD

🔹 1. Use Case Understanding
	•	Identify endpoints that require authentication (protected APIs).
	•	Confirm what kind of auth is used: Bearer token, Basic Auth, API key, etc.

⸻

🔹 2. Define BDD Scenario

The scenario should be high-level like:

“When the client tries to access the protected endpoint without valid credentials, the server should reject the request with a 401 Unauthorized response.”

🔹 3. Ways to Trigger 401 (Test Ideas)
Situation
How to Simulate
Notes
🔸 Missing Token
Don’t include Authorization header
Most basic test
🔸 Empty Token
Send Authorization: Bearer 
API should reject this
🔸 Tampered Token
Modify a character in a valid token
e.g., add abc at the end or replace a digit
🔸 Expired Token (if possible)
Use a token that is known to be expired
Useful if token expiry is short for test purposes
🔸 Invalid Token Format
Send gibberish like Authorization: Bearer 123xyz
Should return 401 instead of 500
🔸 Wrong Authentication Scheme
Use Basic instead of Bearer, or vice versa
e.g., Authorization: Basic xyz


4. Prepare the Test Environment
	•	Have a valid token ready for comparison.
	•	Be able to manipulate headers manually (use Postman first if needed).
	•	Know what a real 401 response looks like (status, body message).

⸻

🔹 5. Execute via BDD Framework

Run your BDD test:
	•	Scenario simulates tampered/missing/invalid token.
	•	Validate response is 401 and not 403, 500, or 200.

⸻

✅ Example Approach for You:

You have a valid bearer token:

Authorization: Bearer eyJhbGciOi...
To simulate 401:
	•	Delete it entirely → simulates no token
	•	Append “abc” → Bearer eyJhbGciOi...abc
	•	Use “12345” instead of token → invalid format
	•	Use expired token if you can fetch one

🧪 Bonus Tip: Difference Between 401 and 403

Code
Meaning
When It Happens
401
Unauthorized
You’re not logged in or token is invalid
403
Forbidden
You are logged in, but not allowed

So 401 = bad or missing credentials, not permissions.
