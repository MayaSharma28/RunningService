1. Understand the Business Use Case
	‚Ä¢	What does the ‚ÄúAffiliate Account Information‚Äù API do?
	‚Ä¢	Who uses it ‚Äî internal services, third parties, customers?
	‚Ä¢	What kind of data is returned? (e.g., name, account ID, affiliate details, status)

‚∏ª

2. Review API Contracts
	‚Ä¢	Validate request/response schemas (using Swagger/OpenAPI).
	‚Ä¢	Check required fields, data types, constraints.
	‚Ä¢	Note any changes due to migration: new fields, removed fields, renamed keys, etc.

‚∏ª

3. Database Migration Impact Analysis

Since data is migrated:
	‚Ä¢	Identify old vs new DB schemas (source vs PostgreSQL).
	‚Ä¢	Analyze if data types or constraints have changed.
	‚Ä¢	Understand data sync flow between PostgreSQL and Yugabyte (replica lag, consistency).
	‚Ä¢	Confirm if Yugabyte is read-only or eventually consistent.

‚∏ª

4. Functional Test Analysis

Prepare test cases for:
	‚Ä¢	Happy Path: Valid affiliate account info is fetched correctly.
	‚Ä¢	Negative Tests:
	‚Ä¢	Invalid/missing account ID.
	‚Ä¢	Unauthorized access.
	‚Ä¢	Data not found.
	‚Ä¢	Boundary Conditions: Large inputs, special characters, etc.
	‚Ä¢	Backward Compatibility: If older clients still hit the API, test for any breakages.

‚∏ª

5. Data Validation Tests

Since the data is migrated:
	‚Ä¢	Write SQL queries to:
	‚Ä¢	Validate data integrity between source and PostgreSQL.
	‚Ä¢	Validate consistency between PostgreSQL and Yugabyte.
	‚Ä¢	For every API call:
	‚Ä¢	Cross-check API response vs DB record in PostgreSQL and Yugabyte.

‚∏ª

6. API Automation Suggestions

Use Rest Assured or Postman to:
	‚Ä¢	Automate API test scenarios.
	‚Ä¢	Add DB validation in Rest Assured (via JDBC) to validate data from Postgres/Yugabyte.

‚∏ª

7. Performance Testing

Use JMeter or Gatling to test:
	‚Ä¢	API response times before and after migration.
	‚Ä¢	Compare latency between PostgreSQL and Yugabyte if the replica is used for reads.
	‚Ä¢	Test how the API handles load (100s-1000s of concurrent users).

‚∏ª

8. Monitoring & Observability Checks
	‚Ä¢	Check logs, error rates, and latency in tools like Splunk, AppDynamics, ELK.
	‚Ä¢	Verify if DB query performance is good after migration (slow queries, indexing issues).

‚∏ª

9. CI/CD Pipeline Analysis
	‚Ä¢	Ensure tests are included in CI/CD pipelines (e.g., Jenkins).
	‚Ä¢	Run DB validation scripts post-deployment as part of smoke testing.

‚∏ª

10. Security & Access Control
	‚Ä¢	Validate auth mechanisms (JWT, OAuth, API Keys).
	‚Ä¢	Ensure sensitive affiliate data is masked or encrypted in transit (HTTPS) and at rest.
	‚Ä¢	Validate role-based access for different user types.

‚∏ª

Final Deliverables (Artifacts You Can Prepare):
	1.	Test Strategy Document (specific to DB migration & API)
	2.	Postman Collection or Rest Assured suite
	3.	SQL Data Validation Scripts
	4.	Test Coverage Report (functional + DB + perf)
	5.	Bug Report/Analysis (if mismatches are found)
Since you‚Äôve already analyzed the core functionality ‚Äî valid input fetching correct data via affiliate account ID and company code, and verified 200 responses with headers like client-id, channel, correlation-id via Bruno ‚Äî here‚Äôs what else you should analyze from a thorough QA perspective:

‚∏ª

1. Response Validation (Beyond Status 200)
	‚Ä¢	Validate all fields in the response body:
	‚Ä¢	Ensure all expected keys are present.
	‚Ä¢	Field-level validations (data types, formats: dates, enums, etc.).
	‚Ä¢	Optional vs mandatory fields.
	‚Ä¢	Example Checks:
	‚Ä¢	Affiliate ID should be a string or UUID.
	‚Ä¢	Company code matches expected format (length, allowed characters).
	‚Ä¢	Dates in ISO 8601 (e.g., 2025-05-14T10:30:00Z).

‚∏ª

2. Negative Scenarios

Test for proper error handling:
	‚Ä¢	Invalid account ID or company code (e.g., 404 or 400 with descriptive message).
	‚Ä¢	Missing parameters in request.
	‚Ä¢	Invalid data types (e.g., numeric string instead of UUID).
	‚Ä¢	Unauthorized/forbidden access (401/403).
	‚Ä¢	SQL injection-type strings (security edge cases).
	‚Ä¢	Expired/invalid tokens or missing headers like client-id.

Check:
	‚Ä¢	Correct status codes.
	‚Ä¢	Informative error messages.
	‚Ä¢	Standard error structure (like { "errorCode": "AFFILIATE_NOT_FOUND", "message": "..." }).

‚∏ª

3. Header Validation

Headers like client-id, channel, correlation-id must:
	‚Ä¢	Be validated if mandatory or optional.
	‚Ä¢	Influence logging/tracking:
	‚Ä¢	Does correlation-id reflect in logs for traceability?
	‚Ä¢	Test behavior with:
	‚Ä¢	Missing headers
	‚Ä¢	Malformed headers
	‚Ä¢	Duplicate headers

‚∏ª

4. Data Consistency
	‚Ä¢	Cross-verify response data with:
	‚Ä¢	PostgreSQL table directly via SQL query
	‚Ä¢	Yugabyte replica (if API reads from there)
	‚Ä¢	Validate whether recent updates in DB are reflected immediately or with lag (especially if Yugabyte is eventually consistent).

‚∏ª

5. Performance/Latency
	‚Ä¢	Note time taken for 200 responses.
	‚Ä¢	Test under load (even basic: 10‚Äì50 threads) to see:
	‚Ä¢	Spike in latency
	‚Ä¢	DB slowness
	‚Ä¢	Timeouts
	‚Ä¢	Errors under load

‚∏ª

6. Audit, Logging, and Traceability

Ask:
	‚Ä¢	Does this service log every request?
	‚Ä¢	Is the correlation-id used to trace logs?
	‚Ä¢	Are there audit logs for access to sensitive affiliate info?

‚∏ª

7. Security Tests
	‚Ä¢	Is authentication enforced correctly?
	‚Ä¢	Token expiry handled gracefully?
	‚Ä¢	Any PII (Personally Identifiable Info) in response?
	‚Ä¢	Check for masking (e.g., email, phone).
	‚Ä¢	Headers like client-id ‚Äî test if they‚Äôre validated or just passed through.
	‚Ä¢	Is the service rate-limited? (try hitting with repeated calls rapidly)

‚∏ª

8. API Contract Stability
	‚Ä¢	Compare actual response with the Swagger contract or Postman schema.
	‚Ä¢	Track if there are any undocumented changes or hidden fields being exposed.

‚∏ª

9. Compatibility Testing

If the client systems are changing or data structure changed post migration:
	‚Ä¢	Check how older consumers handle new/migrated data.
	‚Ä¢	If new fields were introduced ‚Äî are they backward-compatible?

‚∏ª

10. Retry and Idempotency (if applicable)

If this API is used in downstream flows:
	‚Ä¢	Check what happens if the same request is sent multiple times (idempotency).
	‚Ä¢	Analyze retry behavior ‚Äî is it safe?

‚úÖ What is a SOAP Interceptor?

A SOAP interceptor is a mechanism (in frameworks like Spring WS, Apache CXF, etc.) that intercepts the SOAP request or response:
	‚Ä¢	Before it‚Äôs sent to the backend service (request interceptor)
	‚Ä¢	After it‚Äôs received (response interceptor)

It can be used to:
	‚Ä¢	Modify or validate headers
	‚Ä¢	Log or mask data
	‚Ä¢	Inject security tokens
	‚Ä¢	Route or enrich messages

‚∏ª

üîç What to Analyze from a QA Perspective

1. Integration Flow Validation
	‚Ä¢	What is the source of truth? Does the SOAP service fetch account data, or is it cached/mirrored somewhere else?
	‚Ä¢	Understand how the interceptor behaves:
	‚Ä¢	Is it calling another system (e.g., legacy mainframe, ERP)?
	‚Ä¢	Does it transform data before reaching your REST API?

2. SOAP Request & Response Validation

If possible, capture the raw SOAP messages:
	‚Ä¢	Use tools like SoapUI, Wireshark, or application logs.
	‚Ä¢	Validate:
	‚Ä¢	Structure (WSDL-based contract)
	‚Ä¢	Required SOAP headers
	‚Ä¢	Input and output parameters

3. Interceptors Logic
	‚Ä¢	Check what the interceptor does:
	‚Ä¢	Enriches request (adds headers/metadata)?
	‚Ä¢	Filters or validates request (e.g., checks for valid account ID)?
	‚Ä¢	Logs or masks sensitive data?

Try these test cases:

Scenario
Expected Result
Valid input sent to interceptor
Correct response, enriched/processed as needed
Missing/invalid SOAP headers
Proper error returned (e.g., 400 or SOAP Fault)
Malformed XML sent
Interceptor rejects with SOAP fault
Delay in downstream SOAP service
REST API handles it with a timeout or fallback
Retry on failure
If retry logic exists, validate retry behavior
4. Security Testing
	‚Ä¢	Is the interceptor adding authentication tokens, client ID, etc.?
	‚Ä¢	Test with missing or manipulated security headers.
	‚Ä¢	Check if any sensitive data is logged by the interceptor (which shouldn‚Äôt happen).

5. Performance & Timeout Handling
	‚Ä¢	If the SOAP service is slow or fails, validate:
	‚Ä¢	How long the interceptor waits
	‚Ä¢	Whether proper timeouts, error messages, or fallbacks are triggered

6. Error Handling / SOAP Faults
	‚Ä¢	If something goes wrong in the SOAP service, it should return a SOAP Fault.
	‚Ä¢	Validate that:
	‚Ä¢	The fault is captured by the interceptor
	‚Ä¢	The fault is translated into a meaningful error in the REST response (not just 500)

‚∏ª

üõ†Ô∏è Tools You Can Use
	‚Ä¢	SoapUI: For testing SOAP services and sending custom XML requests.
	‚Ä¢	Bruno / Postman: For REST part (but limited SOAP support).
	‚Ä¢	Fiddler / Charles Proxy: To observe traffic if you don‚Äôt have backend access.
	‚Ä¢	Spring Logs / Application Logs: Check for interceptor logging or errors.
What Is a SOAP XML Payload?

SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol) uses XML-based messaging to send requests and receive responses between client and server.

A typical SOAP message consists of:
	‚Ä¢	Envelope: Root element
	‚Ä¢	Header: Optional metadata (e.g., authentication, correlation ID)
	‚Ä¢	Body: Actual request data

‚∏ª

üßæ Sample SOAP Request XML (Affiliate Account Search)

Sample SOAP Request: Affiliate Account Search

Imagine you‚Äôre sending a request to get account details:
<soapenv:Envelope xmlns:soapenv="http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/soap/envelope/"
                  xmlns:acc="http://yourdomain.com/accountservice">
   <soapenv:Header>
      <acc:ClientId>my-client-id</acc:ClientId>
      <acc:Channel>web</acc:Channel>
      <acc:CorrelationId>123456789</acc:CorrelationId>
   </soapenv:Header>

   <soapenv:Body>
      <acc:getAffiliateAccountDetails>
         <acc:affiliateAccountId>AFF12345</acc:affiliateAccountId>
         <acc:companyCode>XYZ001</acc:companyCode>
      </acc:getAffiliateAccountDetails>
   </soapenv:Body>
</soapenv:Envelope>
What You Are Asking for:

‚ÄúHey service, please give me details for affiliate account AFF12345 from company XYZ001.‚Äù
<soapenv:Envelope xmlns:soapenv="http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/soap/envelope/"
                  xmlns:acc="http://yourdomain.com/accountservice">
   <soapenv:Body>
      <acc:getAffiliateAccountDetailsResponse>
         <acc:affiliateAccount>
            <acc:affiliateAccountId>AFF12345</acc:affiliateAccountId>
            <acc:companyCode>XYZ001</acc:companyCode>
            <acc:accountStatus>ACTIVE</acc:accountStatus>
            <acc:createdAt>2024-10-18T10:30:00Z</acc:createdAt>
         </acc:affiliateAccount>
      </acc:getAffiliateAccountDetailsResponse>
   </soapenv:Body>
</soapenv:Envelope>
As a QA, What Should You Check?

‚úÖ Request Validation
	‚Ä¢	Send correct and incorrect account IDs.
	‚Ä¢	Try missing fields like company code or account ID.
	‚Ä¢	Send invalid formats (e.g., special characters).

‚úÖ Header Validation
	‚Ä¢	Is clientId, channel, correlationId required?
	‚Ä¢	What happens if one is missing or incorrect?

‚úÖ Response Validation
	‚Ä¢	Check that the account details returned are accurate.
	‚Ä¢	Are the timestamps (createdAt, modifiedAt) correct?
	‚Ä¢	Compare with the PostgreSQL/Yugabyte DB.

‚úÖ Fault Handling
	‚Ä¢	When service fails (e.g., account not found), is a SOAP Fault returned?
	‚Ä¢	Does the message clearly explain what went wrong?

‚úÖ Security
	‚Ä¢	Do SOAP headers leak any sensitive info?
	‚Ä¢	Do logs capture full request XML (and should they)?

‚∏ª

üõ† Tools to Practice
	1.	SoapUI (best for SOAP testing)
	‚Ä¢	You can paste the XML request and hit send.
	‚Ä¢	It will show the full SOAP response.
	2.	Postman (limited support)
	‚Ä¢	Add a raw text/xml body and set Content-Type: text/xml.
